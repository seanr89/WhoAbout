# Project Context: Marketplace

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Goal:** A brief description of the project. E.g., "This a desk booking system for 1 or more office locations with admin controls to view activity and history, split across a dotnet net web api back-end, postgres and etc..."
*   **Core Features:** 2-3 key features. E.g., "User authentication support, office desk availability and desk booking are the key requirements"

## 2 The Required Tools and Languages

* **My Role:** Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer, Be an expert DevOps Engineer, Serve as a Database Architect
* **Frontend Stack (If applicable):**
    * **Framework/Library:** React (with TypeScript)
    * **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Custom SCSS]
* **Backend Stack (If applicable):**
    * **Language/Framework:** Dotnet minimal web api
    * **APIs:** RESTful API (JSON), GraphQL
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
<!-- * **Deployment/Hosting:** [e.g., AWS EC2 via Docker, Kubernetes cluster, Serverless (Lambda)] -->
* **Version Control & Practices:** Standard Git flow, mandatory use of feature branches, clear commit messages (Conventional Commits)

## 3. Project Structure

A brief description of key directories to help with navigation.
All code items to be stored under `src/`

*   `src/booking-client`: Main react app

## 4. ⚙️ Implementation Details & Constraints

### Specific Coding Requirements

* **Security Requirements:** [e.g., All inputs must be sanitized, Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt, Implement rate limiting on all public-facing endpoints.]
* **Performance Targets:** [e.g., All key API routes must respond in under **100ms** (P95 latency), Support up to **5,000** concurrent users.]
* **Code Quality & Testing:** [e.g., Mandatory unit tests for all business logic, Minimum **85%** code coverage required, Adhere strictly to **ESLint/Prettier** rules.]
* **Documentation Focus:** [e.g., Include docstrings for all major functions/methods, Provide a detailed `README.md` for local setup.]

## 5. 🎯 Deliverables & Next Steps

### The Final Output

* **Required Format:** [e.g., Full directory structure of source code, Detailed Markdown **Technical Design Document (TDD)**, Database Migration script]
* **Structure:** Provide code in separate blocks for each file, mimicking the correct folder structure (e.g., `/src/components/UserList.js`).
* **What to do when finished:** [The immediate next step, e.g., "Provide the **Authentication Module** code and await feedback before starting on the Reporting Module."]
